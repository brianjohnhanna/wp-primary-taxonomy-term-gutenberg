# Primary Taxonomy Term for WordPress

This WordPress plugin adds a primary category dropdown to the Gutenberg post editor document block. The primary category can be useful for SEO purposes and assist publishers and editors in organizing content effectively.

### Todo

[ ] Selecting additional category should not automatically reset the primary
[ ] Hook into post autosave/save instead of saving on `onchange` event of select
[ ] Add template functions & implement hooks for displaying primary category on front-end
[ ] Add option to implement for taxonomies other than just categories
