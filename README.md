[ ] Hook into post autosave/save instead of saving on `onchange` event of select
[ ] Add template functions & implement hooks for displaying primary category on front-end
[ ] Add option to implement for taxonomies other than just categories
[ ] Fix display issue when toggling between Document and Block tabs
[ ] Additional testing
